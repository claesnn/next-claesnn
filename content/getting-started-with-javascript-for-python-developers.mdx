title: Getting started with JavaScript for Python developers

summary: There's tons of choices to make when beginning with JavaScript development. But there's sane defaults you should try out.

JavaScript development is very unlike Python development. In the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), it is said that _"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."_
This is very unlike JavaScript, where a popular saying goes _"There's a new framework every week"_. Interestingly, this is also the case for package management, meta-frameworks, and pretty much every other aspect of JavaScript.
Whilst there's definitely positives to being spoilt for choice, you can easily get burnt by trying out the newest and greatest.

In Python development, you have a single Python runtime, a single package manage (pip), and well established frameworks like Django. Okay, there's also Flask, uv, Poetry and a few others, but the point is that there's a few well established choices that you can't go wrong with.
In JavaScript development, you're immediately faced with all these choices, and it can be overwhelming.

Whilst, you may be tempted to try out the newest and greatest, you can easily get burnt by doing so.
In the following, I'll outline some sane defaults for JavaScript development that you should try out. They'll get you going and you can enjoy making awesome web applications without spending weeks/months trialing different frameworks and toolings.

So, if you're ready to ship great products, let's get started!

## "Installing" JavaScript

Whilst JavaScript can run in the browser. Modern development requires tooling beyond that capabilities of the browser.
As a Python developer you're used to installing Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
For JavaScript, the equivalent is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which is a JavaScript runtime that enables you to run JavaScript outside the browser.

As hinted in the intro, there's a plethora of options for JavaScript runtimes, so already now you're faced with a choice.
Other popular options, include [Deno](https://deno.land/) and the newest and hottest: [Bun](https://bun.sh/). Whilst, you may be tempted hop onto the newest and greatest, I'd recommend starting out with Node.js unless you have a very specific requirement that Node.js doesn't meet.

Sure, Bun can be significantly faster than Node.js, but you're unlikely to run into performance issues using Node.js, especially if you keep your code well optimized and avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies.

On the other hand, what you do get by using Node.js is a painless experience with limited bugs and plenty of documentation. Even though this is always welcome, it's especially important in JavaScript development due to the rapid development pace.

In line with this sentiment, you should install the LTS release (Long Term Support) of Node.js. You can generally expect packages to be compatible with this release and you avoid having to debug cryptic error messages before you've even started.

## How many package managers do you need?

In Python, you're most likely used to using _pip_ for installing and updating Python packages. There's of course also [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (and [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/uv)), but _pip_ is a well established choice for the majority.
Similarly, in JavaScript, there's a sane default in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). It's the default package manager for Node.js and comes pre-installed with Node.js. The great thing is that you can expect most packages to be available and compatible with npm.

Other options include, [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Again, these options can be faster and more optimized than npm, but it's very unlikely that you'll notice any differences
